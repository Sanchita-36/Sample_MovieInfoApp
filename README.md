# Sample_MovieInfoApp
This app has been built as a practice app learnt from a course. 
Sample Movie Info App Layout, the app show the content in Table View, Collection View.

Configurations: 
Swift 5, Xcode version: 11.5 , MacOS version: 10.15.7

How it works: 
The app shows usage of Table View and Collection View. 
On launching the app, a table view appears that shows movie name and details. There is a collection view that shows 5 actors from the movie.  
After clicking on one of the Actors it take to next page where the actors bio is shown along with the actors image.

(I am still working on the actors bio page , will upload the next code within coule of days)

I am still a learner trying to build good applications and get good understanding of iOS Development.
